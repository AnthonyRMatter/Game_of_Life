References for Assignment4: The biggest references that we used for this assignment was GeeksForGeeks when we needed extra help with either pointers or certain commands to pause or exit the game. We went to Professor Rao's office hours every Tuesday and Thursday during the span of the project to get as much help as we could with smaller problems such as segmentation faults or inconsistent results.

Issues for Assignment4: There were plenty of issues that came with this assignment because of how many moving pieces were involved with the project. A big issue that took us a few days to figure out were how to efficiently swap and update the grid multiple times. The other big issue that we ran into early on that took us a couple days to nail down was how to initialize a grid with cells at random positions. Other smaller issues were how to get the user to press ENTER to continue and exit the game, as well as pausing the game, but those issues were not as complex and only took us a few hours. We were able to resolve the big issues by either using our own knowledge of C++ or going to office hours to get Professor Rao's input on how to approach the problem.
